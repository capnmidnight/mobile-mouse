============

Creates a small webserver that serves a page that
you may visit with your phone on a local wifi network 
and control your computer.

The code is kind of crappy and hacked together,
but it should be enough for anyone to fork and
implement their own such program, instead of paying
for one in the Apple or Google Play stores.
